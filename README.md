# Search Term Amplifier

Search Term Amplifier is a Google Ads Script solution that extracts keywords
from the search term(query) report and adds the queried keywords to specified
campaigns and ad groups.

## Instructions

Please read main script and edit "MANDATORY + BASIC Parameters" section
before running the script.

To deploy the script:

1.  Copy it into the
    [Google Ads script editor](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/188712)

2.  Remove the `exports` block at the bottom of the script.

3.  Edit the script's constants and parameters to reflect your preferences and
    requirements.

4.  Test that the script will preform the correct actions by using the preview
    function of the scripts editor.

5.  *Optional*
    [Schedule the script](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/188712?hl=en#:~:text=run%20it%20again.-,Scheduling%20a%20script,-Once%20you%27ve%20created)
    to run on a regular basis automatically.

Running the script will result in keywords being added to the account, if any appropriate search terms are found. If email addresses are added to the configuration, an email will also be sent to the recipients with the results of the execution.

## Configuration

The following constants can be changed to affect how the script executes. They are also documented in the script itself.

### MANDATORY + BASIC Parameters

SCRIPT_NAME : The name used to identify the script in logs and the results email.

CAMPAIGNS : An array of Campaign names to extract search terms from. All Ad Groups within these campaigns will be processed. To include all campaigns, set value to ['__ALL__'] . If empty, the ADGROUPS constant will be used instead.

ADGROUPS : An array of Ad Group names to extract search terms from. Only used if the CAMPAIGNS constant is an empty array.

ENABLE_KEYWORDS : If true, new keywords will be enabled immediately. Otherwise, the keywords are added in a PAUSED state, which allows for a review prior to enabling.
This is not applicable to negative keywords (which are always enabled).

GAQL_QUERY_SEARCH_TERM : This is where you define the criteria for "High Performance." The GAQL query will be used to extract the applicable search terms. Levarage GAQL Query Builder to help you create a query with a different set of filters, if needed.

LABELS : An array of labels to apply to the new keywords (recommended for monitoring & reporting).

MAIL_RECIPIENTS : An array of email addresses that will receive the results email after the script is executed. No email will be sent if this array is empty.


### Additional Parameters (for advanced use-cases)

IGNORE_WORDS : An array of terms that will be not be created as new keywords. This can replace negative keywords as means to ensure certain words and phrases are not used. Please note that this is a literal list, and only exact matches will be ignored.

ADD_KEYWORDS_TO_DIFFERENT_ADGROUP : A boolean flag to specify whether new keywords should be added to a specific Ad Group, specified by the ADGROUP_TO_ADD_SEARCH_KEYWORDS constant.

ADGROUP_TO_ADD_SEARCH_KEYWORDS : If ADD_KEYWORDS_TO_DIFFERENT_ADGROUP is true, new keywords will be added to the Ad Group specified here.

ADDED_KEYWORDS_MAX_CPC : The maximum CPC to set for added keywords. If this is set to false, no CPC will be set. This is not applicable to negative keywords.

SET_FINAL_URL : If true, the function specified by buildFinalUrl will be used to set the final URL for new keywords.

SET_MOBILE_FINAL_URL : If true, the function specified by buildMobileFinalUrl will be used to set the final mobile URL for new keywords.

OVERWRITE_KEYWORDS : If true, the keywords status and CPC (if applicable) will be overwritten if the keywords already exists. This is not applicable to negative keywords.

IS_NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS : If this is true, new keywords will be added as negative keywords instead of search keywords. We suggest using this sparingly to better allow the Google Ads systems to maximize coverage.
